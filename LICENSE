Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.

Software

"Software" means the software the licensor makes available under
these terms, including any portion of it.

Purpose

These terms let you use the software for noncommercial purposes.
You may not use the software for commercial purposes.

If you follow these terms, the licensor grants you a nonexclusive,
worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to:

  - use, copy, distribute, and make the software available to others,
  - prepare derivative works of the software,

in each case for noncommercial purposes only.

Noncommercial

"Noncommercial" means not primarily intended for, or directed toward,
commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

Attribution

You must give appropriate credit to the original author (jbgriesner),
provide a link to the original repository
(https://github.com/jbgriesner/valt), and indicate if changes were
made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that
suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

No Sublicensing

You may not sublicense the software. Each time you distribute the
software or a derivative work, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the licensor on these same terms.

No Other Rights

These terms do not imply any licenses other than those expressly

licensed, and your licenses will automatically terminate. If the
licensor notifies you of your violation, and you cease all violation
within thirty days after your notification, your licenses will
reinstate retroactively.

No Liability

As far as the law allows, the software comes AS IS, without any
warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for
any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the
software, under any kind of legal claim.
